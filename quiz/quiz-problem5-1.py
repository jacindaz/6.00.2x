"""
You are taking a class that plans to assign final grades based on two midterm
quizzes and a final exam. The final grade will be based on 25% for each midterm,
and 50% for the final. You are told that the grades on the exams were each
uniformly distributed integers:

    Midterm 1: 50 <= grade <= 80
    Midterm 2: 60 <= grade <= 90
    Final Exam: 55 <= grade <= 95

Write a function called sampleQuizzes() that implements a Monte Carlo simulation
that estimates the probability of a student having a final score >= 70 and <= 75.
Assume that 10,000 trials are sufficient to provide an accurate answer.
